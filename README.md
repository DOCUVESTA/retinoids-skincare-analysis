![Retinoic Acid](https://github.com/DOCUVESTA/retinoid-skincare-analysis/blob/2019a2f5b488c3102423602a49abfd6c20db6fe7/assets/Retinoic%20Acid.png)

## Overview
As a skincare enthusiast, I wasn't surprised in the recent surge in demand for skincare products with retinoids. Retinoids are vitamin-A derivative compounds that are known to be effective treatments for a wide range of skin problems, including acne. In this repository, I perform an analysis on skincare products that contain different type of retinoids. The objective of this analysis is to provide consumers with a foundation of knowledge on the benefits, side effects and characteristics of various retinoids, allowing the users to select the best option for their individual skincare needs. Additionally, the analysis will examine any market gaps for product types and retinoid ingredients that could be worth exploring for brands that wish to develop retinoid skincare.
